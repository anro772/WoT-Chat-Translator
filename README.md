## Requirements

- World of Tanks (tested on 2.0.0.0)
- Python 2.7 (only needed if building from source)
- Microsoft Azure Translator API key (only needed if building from source)

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Download Pre-built (Easiest)
Download the ready-to-use mod from [WoTMods.com](https://wotmods.com) - no configuration needed!

### Option 2: Build Your Own (Recommended for Developers)
Build from source with your own FREE Microsoft API key (2M characters/month)

## Building From Source

### Step 1: Get Your Free API Key
1. Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/
2. Click "Try Azure for free" 
3. Create a "Translator" resource (2 million characters free/month!)
4. Copy your API key and region from "Keys and Endpoint"

### Step 2: Add Your API Keys

Edit `mod_MicrosoftTranslator.py` and replace the placeholders on lines 20-21:

```python
# Before (line 20-21)
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
API_REGION = 'YOUR_REGION_HERE'

# After (with your actual credentials)
API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_from_azure'
API_REGION = 'your_actual_region'  # e.g., 'eastus', 'westeurope', 'switzerlandnorth'
```

**That's it!** No environment variables or .env files needed - just edit these two lines.

### Step 3: Build the Mod
```bash
python build.py
```

This will create `build/ChatTranslator.wotmod`

### Step 4: Install
Copy `ChatTranslator.wotmod` to your World of Tanks mods folder:
- Windows: `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\<game_version>\`
- Example: `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\2.0.0.0\`

**That's it!** Launch World of Tanks and foreign messages will be translated automatically.


## How It Works

The mod hooks into World of Tanks' messenger system to intercept chat messages before they're displayed. When a non-English message is detected:

1. **Language Detection**: Microsoft Translator API automatically detects the source language
2. **Translation**: Message is translated to English with confidence scoring
3. **Display Format**: `[RO‚Üíen] Hello | salut` (shows source language, translation, and original)
4. **Caching**: Translations are cached to avoid repeated API calls

### Technical Details

- **Async Translation**: Battle and training room messages use async translation with 8-second timeout to prevent lag
- **Sync Translation**: Platoon messages use synchronous translation for reliability
- **Smart Detection**: Common English words and gaming phrases are detected to skip unnecessary translations
- **API Efficiency**: Messages with >85% English confidence are skipped

## Troubleshooting

### Check Logs
Debug logs are saved to `microsoft_translator.log` in your World of Tanks folder.

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized Error**
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify the region matches your Azure resource
- Ensure your Azure subscription is active

**Messages Not Translating**
- Check if messages are already in English (85% confidence threshold)
- Verify API credentials are set correctly
- Check logs for specific errors

**Lag During Translation**
- This is normal for the first translation (API call)
- Subsequent identical messages use cache (instant)
- Battle chat uses async to minimize impact
